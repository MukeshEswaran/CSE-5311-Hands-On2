## 2. Argue Selection Sort correctness
Selection Sort is a simple, intuitive sorting algorithm that ensures the smallest element from the unsorted part is added to the sorted part in each iteration. While not the most efficient for large datasets, its correctness and stability are easily proven by the invariants maintained during its execution (as seen above). The performance results from your benchmarks align with theoretical expectations, confirming the algorithm's correct implementation and behavior.


It is the most efficent beacuse :
* Always Finds the Minimum: At each step, Selection Sort correctly identifies and places the smallest unsorted element into its correct position.
* Step-by-Step Sorting: After each pass through the list, one more element is correctly sorted into its final position. This guarantees that by the end, the entire list is sorted.
